    status codes for a variety of common situations.

  URI: urn:ietf:id:amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  abstract: This document describes ALPS, a data format for defining simple descriptions
    of application-level semantics, similar in complexity to HTML microformats. An
    ALPS document can be used as a profile to explain the application semantics of
    a document with an application-agnostic media type (such as HTML, HAL, Collection+JSON,
    Siren, etc.). This increases the reusability of profile documents across media
    types.

  name: RFC 8246
  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:8246
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8246
  abstract: The immutable HTTP response Cache-Control extension allows servers to
    identify resources that will not be updated during their freshness lifetime. This
    ensures that a client never needs to revalidate a cached fresh resource to be
    certain it has not been modified.

  name: RFC 7089
  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:7089
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089
  abstract: The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It
    facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing
    datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content
    negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred
    datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate
    prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing
    a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource.

  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:7540
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540
  abstract: This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics
    of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use
    of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header
    field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection.
    It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.
    This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message
    syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.

  abstract: The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is
    an HTTP-based protocol that makes managing identities in multi-domain scenarios
    easier to support via a standardized service. Examples include, but are not limited
    to, enterprise-to-cloud service providers and inter-cloud scenarios.  The specification
    suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing
    specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying
    existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models.  SCIM's intent is
    to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a
    common user schema, an extension model, and a service protocol defined by this
    document.
