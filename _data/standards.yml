  title: Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS)
  name: Internet Draft amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  URI: urn:ietf:id:amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  abstract: This document describes ALPS, a data format for defining simple descriptions
    of application-level semantics, similar in complexity to HTML microformats. An
    ALPS document can be used as a profile to explain the application semantics of
    a document with an application-agnostic media type (such as HTML, HAL, Collection+JSON,
    Siren, etc.). This increases the reusability of profile documents across media
    types.

  abstract: This specification defines the Sunset HTTP response header field, which
    indicates that a URI is likely to become unresponsive at a specified point in
    the future. It also defines a sunset link relation type that allows linking to
    resources providing information about an upcoming resource or service sunset.

  name: RFC 6749
  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:6749
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749
  abstract: The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application
    to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner
    by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP
    service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own
    behalf. This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described
    in RFC 5849.

  abstract: This specification describes how to use bearer tokens in HTTP requests
    to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources. Any party in possession of a bearer token
    (a "bearer") can use it to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating
    possession of a cryptographic key). To prevent misuse, bearer tokens need to be
    protected from disclosure in storage and in transport.

  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:7540
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540
  abstract: This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics
    of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use
    of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header
    field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection.
    It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.
    This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message
    syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.

  abstract: The immutable HTTP response Cache-Control extension allows servers to

    ensures that a client never needs to revalidate a cached fresh resource to be
    certain it has not been modified.

  name: RFC 7644
  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:7644
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644
  abstract: The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is an HTTP-based
    protocol that makes managing identities in multi-domain scenarios easier to support via a standardized service.
    Examples include, but are not limited to, enterprise-to-cloud service providers and inter-cloud scenarios.
    The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments,
    placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication,
    authorization, and privacy models. SCIM's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user
    management operations by providing a common user schema, an extension model,
    and a service protocol defined by this document.
