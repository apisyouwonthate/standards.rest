  title: Additional HTTP Status Codes
  name: RFC 6585
  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:6585

    status codes for a variety of common situations.

  name: Internet Draft amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  URI: urn:ietf:id:amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  abstract: This document describes ALPS, a data format for defining simple descriptions
    of application-level semantics, similar in complexity to HTML microformats. An
    ALPS document can be used as a profile to explain the application semantics of
    a document with an application-agnostic media type (such as HTML, HAL, Collection+JSON,
    Siren, etc.). This increases the reusability of profile documents across media
    types.

  title: HTTP Immutable Responses
  name: RFC 8246
  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:8246
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8246
  abstract: The immutable HTTP response Cache-Control extension allows servers to
    identify resources that will not be updated during their freshness lifetime. This
    ensures that a client never needs to revalidate a cached fresh resource to be
    certain it has not been modified.

  title: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2
  name: RFC 7540
  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:7540
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540
  abstract: This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics
    of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use
    of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header
    field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection.
    It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.
    This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message
    syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.

  abstract: The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is
    an HTTP-based protocol that makes managing identities in multi-domain scenarios
    easier to support via a standardized service. Examples include, but are not limited
    to, enterprise-to-cloud service providers and inter-cloud scenarios.  The specification
    suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing
    specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying
    existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models.  SCIM's intent is
    to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a
    common user schema, an extension model, and a service protocol defined by this
    document.

  abstract: The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application
    to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner
    by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP
    service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own
    behalf. This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described
    in RFC 5849.

    (a "bearer") can use it to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating
    possession of a cryptographic key). To prevent misuse, bearer tokens need to be
