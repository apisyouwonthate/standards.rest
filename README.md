# Standards.REST

A collection of standards, specifications, etc. for HTTP API development.

This site is a resource for developers, interested in reusing wheels instead of reinventing them. We
are powered by [webconcepts.info](http://webconcepts.info/), but we are not limited to just that data source.

We will be adding more human-friendly information for the average developer, tutorials, examples, links to videos or talks, etc: all in a bit to make this stuff more accessible.

## Adding Standards

Pop over to `_data/interest.yml` and shove your favourite standards all up in it. They can either be JSON Pointers to content in [webconcepts.info/specs.json](http://webconcepts.info/specs.json), or go in the `custom` block.
